Project 2 - Implement a simple 3D dynamic elastic object

The project creates a cube of tetrahedra. It anchors just one point in the corner of the cube, and twists the rest of the cube away from the point, then lets it re-settle using CG. 

Compiled on Linux. from the outermost P2 Folder:
$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./P2/P2

This will create NewbyP2.usda
$usdview NewbyP2.usda
